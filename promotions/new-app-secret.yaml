# Example promotion manifest
# This file defines a secret to be promoted from a source namespace to a destination namespace.

source:
  # The namespace where the secret currently exists
  namespace: "staging"
  # The mount point of the KV store (e.g., 'secret', 'kv')
  mount: "stag-keys"
  # The path to the secret (relative to the mount point)
  path: "new-app-stag"

destination:
  # The namespace where the secret should be promoted to
  namespace: "prod"
  # The mount point of the KV store
  mount: "secrets"
  # The path where the secret should be written
  path: "new-app"
# Optional: Specify keys for partial promotion
# If omitted or empty, all keys from the source secret will be promoted.
# If specified, only the listed keys will be promoted and merged with
# any existing keys at the destination path.
promote_keys:
  - "appkey"
  - "apptoken"
